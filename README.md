# Cortana++

Cortana++ is a lightweight machine learning engine built from scratch in C++ with CUDA acceleration.  
It is designed to explore the foundations of deep learning, custom GPU programming, and efficient model training without relying on heavy external libraries.

## Why Cortana++?

- To deeply understand and optimize the inner workings of machine learning at the system level.
- To build an independent, lightweight engine capable of running and training neural networks.
- To combine the power of C++ and CUDA for maximum performance and control.
- And I like HALO.

## Goals

- Implement core machine learning components (tensors, layers, optimizers) from scratch.
- Accelerate computation using custom CUDA kernels.
- Focus on simplicity, efficiency, and full transparency over the training process.
- Enable small-scale experiments in AI design, reasoning, and optimization.
